 * A published harness package ships `lib/` and `.d.ts` but no sources, and its

 * nothing a test runner can import. Rather than fail the whole vitest config
 * (which would take the node-only specs down with it), the alias points here,
 * and only a spec that actually reaches for the harness sees this throw.
